            <h1 style="color: black;">About U.A.T</h1>
            <p>
                Founded in 1970, the University of Aurum Technology (UAT) began as a pioneering institution focused on
                harnessing the power of emerging technologies. Established during a time of rapid advancement in
                computing and engineering, the university aimed to provide a cutting-edge education that bridged the gap
                between theoretical knowledge and practical application.

                <br><br>From its humble beginnings with a single building and a small cohort of dedicated students, UAT
                has grown into a world-class institution, offering a wide range of programs in engineering, information
                technology, business, and sciences. In the early years, UAT became renowned for its forward-thinking
                approach to education, emphasizing hands-on learning, research collaboration, and innovation. <br><br>By
                the 1990s, UAT was at the forefront of the digital revolution, with its graduates making significant
                contributions to both local and global industries.

                <br><br>Over the years, the university expanded its facilities, invested in state-of-the-art
                laboratories, and fostered partnerships with major corporations and research institutions. <br><br>In
                the 2000s, UAT embraced the rise of AI, robotics, and cybersecurity, offering new programs to meet the
                demands of the ever-evolving tech landscape. Today, the University of Aurum Technology stands as a
                leader in technological education, research, and innovation. With a diverse student body, renowned
                faculty, and a commitment to shaping the future, UAT continues to inspire the next generation of
                thinkers, innovators, and leaders

                        <h3>The U.A.T Seal</h3>
                        <p>
                            Representing the rich heritage and its focus on academic excellence, technology, and
                            innovation. The passion of pursuing knowledge, while maintaining a steadfast commitment to
                            nurturing both intellect and creativity. <br><br>Embodying global perspective and its
                            commitment to equipping students for the international stage. The slightly darker gold and
                            red hues lend the seal a sense of authority and tradition, representing the university’s
                            stability and timeless values.

                            The logo embodies the core values, with the golden retriever standing proudly in the center,
                            showcasing loyalty, wisdom, and forward-thinking. Its circular frame signifies continuity
                            and the university’s enduring commitment to growth and innovation in the technological and
                            academic world.
                            <br><br>The overall palette showcases a bright gold that shines brightly, symbolizing
                            excellence and achievement. The university’s use of gold also reflects the name of the
                            university ‘Aurum’ which came from the periodic table of element ‘Au’ that derives from the
                            Latin aurum, for Aurora, the goddess of dawn.
                            <br><br>It further represents the idea of transformation - just as gold is forged and
                            refined, students at the U.A.T are molded into future leaders in the fields of science and
                            technology.
